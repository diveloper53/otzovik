Simple review website created for publishing information about carparks and getting user feedback about them.

P.S. You can change fields in code, and, publish info not about carparks, but about other websites for example.

Design and frontend can be changed in */templates* folder.

So... Anything else here? I maded this project year ago, but published only for now. That's all I think ;p
